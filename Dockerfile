# example of a Docker container for CUDA.jl with a specific toolkit embedded at run time.
#
# supports selecting a Julia and CUDA toolkit version, as well as baking in specific
# versions of the CUDA.jl package (identified by a spec recorgnized by the Pkg REPL).
#
# CUDA.jl and other packages are shipped in a system depot, with the user depot mounted
# at `/depot`. persistency is possible by mounting a volume at this location.
# running with reduced privileges (by using `--user`) is also supported.
