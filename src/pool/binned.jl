# binned memory pool allocator
#
# the core design is a pretty simple:
# - bin allocations into multiple pools according to their size (see `poolidx`)
# - when requested memory, check the pool for unused memory, or allocate dynamically
# - conversely, when released memory, put it in the appropriate pool for future use


## tunables

const MAX_POOL = 2^27 # 128 MiB

const USAGE_WINDOW = 5

# min and max time between successive background task iterations.
# when the pool usages don't change, scan less regularly.
#
# together with USAGE_WINDOW, this determines how long it takes for objects to get reclaimed
const MIN_DELAY = 1.0
const MAX_DELAY = 5.0
