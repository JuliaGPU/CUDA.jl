# global state management

# The functionality in this file serves to create a coherent environment to perform
# computations in, with support for Julia constructs like tasks (and executing those on
# multiple threads), using a GPU of your choice (with the ability to reset that device, or
# use different devices on different threads).

## initialization

# Many CUDA APIs, like the CUDA driver API used by CUDA.jl, use implicit thread-local state
# to determine, e.g., which device to use. With Julia however, code is grouped in tasks.
# Execution can switch between them, and tasks can be executing on (and in the future
# migrate between) different threads. To synchronize these two worlds, we try to detect task
# and thread switches, making sure CUDA's state is mirrored appropriately.

# If you need to maintain your own task-local state, subscribe to device and task switch
# events using [`CUDA.atdeviceswitch`](@ref) and [`CUDA.attaskswitch`](@ref) for proper
# invalidation. If your state is device-specific, but global (i.e. not task-bound), it
# suffices to index your state with the current [`deviceid()`](@ref) and invalidate that
# state when the device is reset by subscribing to [`CUDA.atdevicereset()`](@ref).
